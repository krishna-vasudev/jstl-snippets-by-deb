# JSTL snippets by deb

JSTL snippets by deb contains almost all possible JSTL snippets. It is easy to access them by just typing a few related letters to the name of snippet as shown in the below gifs and images.

 The best thing is just create the file with .jsp extension and keep the Language mode as HTML. This takes care that you can access both emmet features and jstl-snippets-by-deb features at the same time.
 
  It works only for HTML language mode which is default for jsp. If it is different just change it from the bottom right corner.
